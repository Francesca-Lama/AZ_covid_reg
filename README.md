# AZ_covid_reg
In this project I was tasked to run linear, lasso, and ridge regressions on the effect COVID-19 had on daily visits to supermarkets and restuarants in the most populated cities in Arizona. 
I was able to do this by combining multiple data sets and cleaning them to select the independent variables I wanted to regress on.
